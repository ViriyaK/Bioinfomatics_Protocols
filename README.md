Repo for bioinfomatics protocols gathered by me in my time in the Yu Lab.
Made with Quarto books, published using GitHub Pages with https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#github-action option.

Currently, you have to fully re-render locally and then push changes to GitHub for the changes to be reflected on the github page.
